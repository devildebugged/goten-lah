# Goten

## A Minimal Matrix Library in Go

Goten is a minimalist matrix library written in pure Go (for now).
Designed for learning, hacking, and experimenting — without the bloat of full scientific stacks.

- Fast
- Educational
- Lightweight
- Hackable
- Built for tinkerers

## Why Goten Exists

Nested slices suck. Most matrix tasks in Go turn into verbose for-loop hell.

Instead of pulling in heavyweights like Gonum or NumGo, Goten gives you just enough to do matrix math _your way_ — from the ground up.

Perfect if you're learning, benchmarking, or just bored.

## Who Made This?

A bored CS undergrad who got tired of studying and thought:
_"Screw it, I’ll build NumPy in Go."_
